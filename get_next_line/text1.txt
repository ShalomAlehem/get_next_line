Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin was a Georgian revolutionary and political
leader who ruled the Soviet Union from 1927 until his death in 1953. He
served as both General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union (1922–1952) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet
Union (1941–1953). Despite initially governing the country as part of a
collective leadership, he ultimately consolidated power to become the
Soviet Union's dictator by the 1930s. A communist ideologically committed
to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, Stalin formalised these ideas
as Marxism–Leninism while his own policies are known as Stalinism.
